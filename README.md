# Password_Generator

Working with:
- Tkinter library (Canvas widget)
- JSON
- Errors and Exceptions (try, except, else, finally)
- IDE: PyCharm

Descroption:<br>
Creates a password for the given website/name and e-mail address and then saves the data in JSON format after approval. Gives you the ability to search for a saved password by the name under which it was created. The box-informing about the need to fill in all fields prevents saving incomplete data. In order to avoid errors, exception handling (try/except/else method) has been implemented in the code.
